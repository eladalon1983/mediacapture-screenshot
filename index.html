        This document proposes a new API aimed at grabbing a screenshot of either the current
        viewport, the current window or the current screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extending this API beyond the current viewport/window/screen is possible, but we avoid it
        for the time being. The rationale for this decision is discussed further below.

      <section id="sample-use-case">
        <h3>Sample Use Case</h3>
        <p>
          Applications often present end users the option to file feedback. This feedback can be
          used to report bugs about the application itself, or about its interaction with either the
          user agent or the operating system. When reporting such defects, it is often true that a
          picture is worth a thousand words.

        <h3>Insufficiency of Workarounds</h3>
        <p>
          Current mechanisms exist for an application to grab a screenshot. They all have
          significant associated issues, necessitating the definition of a new API.
        </p>
        <section id="workarounds-using-get-display-media">
          <h4>Workarounds using getDisplayMedia</h4>
          <p>
            Applications sometimes use
            <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, then
            attempt to grab a single frame from the resulting video track. This workaround is
            problematic on several accounts:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The user is compelled to grant the application permission to grab multiple frames. If
              the user is not careful to manually revoke that permission, the application could be
              spying on the user for a long time after the initial permission is granted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if the user or the application cut the capture after a single frame, the user
              does not really know what that frame contained, as the application can quickly flash a
              cross-origin iframe, record the frame where that iframe was visible, then immediately
              hide/unload the iframe and terminate the capture.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <section id="workarounds-using-dom-redrawing">
          <h4>Workarounds using Redrawing</h4>
          <p>
            Some libraries exist for redrawing a part of the DOM onto a
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element"
              >Canvas</a
            >.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The main problem with such workarounds is that they do not work well for cross-origin
              content, leading to a discrepancy between what the user sees on their screen, and what
              is captured as an image.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, these solutions are by definition confined to producing a screenshot of
              the
              <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-browser">browser</a>
              <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-display-surface">display surface</a>, whereas an
              ideal screenshot-producing solution would allow grabbing an image of the
              <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-windows">window</a> or
              <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-monitor">monitor</a>.

          <h4>Workarounds using Extensions</h4>
          <p>
            Various browser extensions exist aiming to fill in the gap in the web platform. Reliance
            on extensions suffers from several issues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Most importantly, the various well-known privacy and security issues associated with
              compelling the user to install third-party software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Awkward user flow requiring the installation of what essentially amounts to
              third-party software.

        <section id="workarounds-using-manual-upload">
          <h4>Workarounds using Manual Screenshot Upload</h4>
          <p>
            It is possible to direct the user to take a screenshot manually, using whatever tools
            are available on the user's operating system, and then ask the user to hand the
            application that file.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              This creates a very awkward user journey, and requires that the user would either
              already know how to take a screenshot, or that the user be instructed how do to so on
              their specific operating system. On many popular modern operating system, the keyboard
              shortcuts required are elaborated, excluding less tech-savvy users.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user's choice is limited to grabbing a screenshot of the entire screen or of a
              window; the ability to take a screenshot of just the web-application is missing.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <section id="workarounds-using-dev-tools">
          <h4>Workarounds using Developer Tools</h4>
          <p>
            Most modern browsers include a Developer Tools module which includes the ability to grab
            a screenshot. An application can direct the user to use one of these and to then share
            with the application the resulting image.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should go without saying that this workaround is
            <bold>highly perilous</bold> for the user, as directions to use the Developer Tools
            module could easily lead to the user being asked to help the application exceed the
            permissions which it should have.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reputable applications would never direct the user to make use of the Developer Tools
            module. Tech-savvy users would find such instruction highly suspect, whereas unsavvy
            users would often find the instruction difficult to follow.

          No good workaround exists, yet the capability is highly desired on the web, as evidenced

          workarounds. An API for accomplishing this is necessary.

              When the {{captureScreenshot()}} method is invoked, the User Agent MUST run the
              following steps before proceeding:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If the [=relevant global object=] of [=this=] does not have [=transient
                activation=], the user agent MUST return a [=rejected=] promise with a
                {{DOMException}} object whose {{DOMException/name}} attribute has the value
                {{InvalidStateError}}.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the <a>current settings object</a>'s [=environment settings object/responsible
                document=] is NOT [=Document/fully active=], the user agent MUST return a
                [=rejected=] promise with a {{DOMException}} object whose {{DOMException/name}}
                attribute has the value {{InvalidStateError}}.
              </li>
              <li>
                If {{captureScreenshot()}} is called from a document lacking the
                [=screenshot-policy|screenshot=] {{PermissionsPolicy}}, the user agent MUST return a
                [=rejected=] promise with a {{DOMException}} object whose {{DOMException/name}}
                attribute has the value {{NotAllowedError}}.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user agent SHOULD inspect the DOM and return a [=rejected=] promise if it
                suspicious behavior is detected, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    An overlaid cross-origin iframe at an opacity that's likely to escape the user's
                    notice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An overlaid cross-origin iframe displayed inside the viewport using a suspicious
                    size in a way that the user agent suspected might be intended to escape the
                    user's notice.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The user agent MAY compared the document's URL against a list of suspicious sites
                and return a [=rejected=] promise if it believes the likelihood of trickery is high.
                The user agent MAY also degrade <var>surface</var> based on the same criteria, or
                let the URL otherwise influence its sensitivity when evaluating suspicious behavior
                in any of the previous steps.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If all of these validations pass, the user agent MUST then return promise
              <code>p</code> to the application, and present the user with a prompt containing a
              preview of the screenshot.
            </p>
            <p>
              If <var>surface</var> was anything [=surface-size|larger=] than
              {{ScreenshotSurfaceType/viewport}}, the user agent nevertheless MUST offer all
              [=surface-size|smaller=] surfaces as well, so as to prevent the user being compelled
              into sharing more than they would like.
            </p>
            <p>
              This preview MUST be large enough for the user to be able to inspect it reasonably. It
              is recommended that the user agent provide a mechanism to zoom in or magnify the
              preview.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user agent SHOULD provide the user with mechanisms to crop the image or black out
              parts of it. Although the application is better positioned to perform such image
              manipulation than the user agent, the rationale here is that the user should be able
              to reduce the amount of information shared with an application to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user agent SHOULD add a random delay between when {{captureScreenshot()}} is
              called and when the screenshot is taken and presented to the user. This makes it
              harder for a malicious application to flash new content to the screen exactly at the
              time that the preview is presented to the user, thereby escaping the user's notice and
              gaining their approval of the screenshot based on the content they saw before the
              preview was presented.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user does not approve the screenshot, the user agent MUST [=reject=]
              <code>p</code> with a {{DOMException}} object whose {{DOMException/name}} attribute
              has the value {{AbortError}}.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user approves the screenshot, the user agent MUST resolve <code>p</code> with a
              {{CaptureScreenshotResultType}} constructed with the
              {{CaptureScreenshotResultType/surface}} the user ultimately chose and the
              {{CaptureScreenshotResultType/image}} resulting from the user's cropping and otherwise
              editing of the initial screenshot.
